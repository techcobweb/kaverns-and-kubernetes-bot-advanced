## Story #1 Facilitator notes
To start without monsters:
```script
export ROLE="SERVER"
npm start
```

They will need a URL including your external IP address, rather than localhost.
Find your ip address by looking at the last line of the `ifconfig` command.
Or run this:
```
ifconfig | tail -1 | cut -f2 -d' '
```
